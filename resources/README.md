These are Cordova resources. You can replace icon.png and splash.png and run
`ionic cordova resources` to generate custom icons and splash screens for your
app. See `ionic cordova resources --help` for details.

- Splash Screens: https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/reference/cordova-plugin-splashscreen/

To update images, make sure that you have icon (1024 x 1024) and splash (2732 x 2732) in resources folder.
